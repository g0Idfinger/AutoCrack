# AutoCrack
* Automate cracking Active Directory Passwords with Hashcat

* Run install.sh to move the combined.rule into your hashcat rules dir, optionally change the script to whatever ruleset you want.
* dump ntds.dit and SYSTEM from active directory and put them into a folder of your choosing
* change the variables at top of script to match your liking
